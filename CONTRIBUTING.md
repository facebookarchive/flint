# Contributing to flint
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

Just submit pull requests as is usual for git (thank you!). We won't
pull the request directly though. Upon approval, we'll cherry-pick
your changes internally while of course maintaining you as an author,
and then we'll publish them to github. After all that, we'll close the
pull request.

This somewhat roundabout process is motivated by our need to maintain
an internal source of truth inside the larger context of our larger
internal repository.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
